## ANOVA Table 



| Source       | Sum of Squares (SS)  | Degrees of Freedom (DF) | Mean Square (MS) | 
|--------------|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Regression   | $SSR = 43146.9296$           | $dfR = 1$                       | $MSR = \frac{SSR}{dfR}=\frac{43146.9296}{1}=43146.9296$       |
| Error        | $SSE = SST - SSR = 45007.2 -43146.9296 = 1860.2704$            | $dfE = n - 2 = 3$                       | $MSE=\frac{SSE}{dfE}=\frac{1860.2704}{3}=620.0901$         |
| Total        | $SST = 45007.2$              | $dfR + dfE = 1 + 3 = 4$                       |                  |



## Solution

Given:
- Total Sum of Squares (SS<sub>Total</sub>) = 45007.2
- Regression Sum of Squares (SSR) = 43146.9296

### The Coefficient of Determination (r<sup>2</sup>)

The coefficient of determination is calculated as the ratio of SSR to SS<sub>Total</sub>:

- r<sup>2</sup> = SSR / SS<sub>Total</sub> = 43146.9296 / 45007.2 ≈ 0.9587 = 95.87%

### Interpretation

The coefficient of determination, r<sup>2</sup>, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

In this case, an r<sup>2</sup> value of 95.87% indicates that 95.87% of the total variation in the number of books can be explained by the linear model involving the time in months. This high value suggests a strong linear relationship between the number of books and the time in months.
