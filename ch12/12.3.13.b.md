## ANOVA table

| Source of Variation | Sum of Squares (SS) | Degrees of Freedom (DF) | Mean Square (MS) | F-Statistic |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Regression          | \( SS_{\text{Regression}} = 216604.22 \) | \( DF_{\text{Regression}} = 1 \) | \( MS_{\text{Regression}} = 216604.22 \) | \( F = 6.728 \) |
| Error               | \( SS_{\text{Error}} = 128867.27 \)      | \( DF_{\text{Error}} = 4 \)     | \( MS_{\text{Error}} = 32216.82 \)       |             |
| Total               | \( SS_{\text{Total}} = 345471.2 \)       | \( DF_{\text{Total}} = 5 \)    |                   |             |

# Regression Analysis Results

## Part (a): Calculation of the Coefficient of Determination

Given:
- Total Sum of Squares (SS<sub>Total</sub>) = 45007.2
- Regression Sum of Squares (SSR) = 43146.9296

### The Coefficient of Determination (R<sup>2</sup>)

The coefficient of determination is calculated as the ratio of SSR to SS<sub>Total</sub>:

R<sup>2</sup> = SSR / SS<sub>Total</sub> = 43146.9296 / 45007.2 ≈ 0.9587 = 95.87%

### Interpretation

The coefficient of determination, R<sup>2</sup>, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

In this case, an R<sup>2</sup> value of 95.87% indicates that 95.87% of the total variation in the number of books can be explained by the linear model involving the time in months. This high value suggests a strong linear relationship between the number of books and the time in months.
