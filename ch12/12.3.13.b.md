## ANOVA Table for Linear Regression

### Formulas Used:
- **Mean of Independent Variable (x̄):**
  x̄ = Σx / n
- **Mean of Dependent Variable (ȳ):**
  ȳ = Σy / n
- **Total Sum of Squares (SST):**
  SST = Σ(yᵢ - ȳ)²
- **Regression Sum of Squares (SSR):**
  SSR = Σ(ŷᵢ - ȳ)²
- **Error Sum of Squares (SSE):**
  SSE = SST - SSR
- **Degrees of Freedom for Regression (DFR):**
  DFR = k - 1
- **Degrees of Freedom for Error (DFE):**
  DFE = n - k
- **Mean Squares for Regression (MSR):**
  MSR = SSR / DFR
- **Mean Squares for Error (MSE):**
  MSE = SSE / DFE
- **F-statistic:**
  F = MSR / MSE

### ANOVA Table:
| Source       | SS          | DF  | MS     | F     |
|--------------|-------------|-----|--------|-------|
| Regression   | 31345.2     | 4   | 7836.3 | 1.558 |
| Residual     | 15089.6     | 3   | 5029.9 |       |
| Total        | 46434.8     | 7   |        |       |

# Regression Analysis Results

## Part (a): Calculation of the Coefficient of Determination

Given:
- Total Sum of Squares (SS<sub>Total</sub>) = 45007.2
- Regression Sum of Squares (SSR) = 43146.9296

### The Coefficient of Determination (r<sup>2</sup>)

The coefficient of determination is calculated as the ratio of SSR to SS<sub>Total</sub>:

r<sup>2</sup> = SSR / SS<sub>Total</sub> = 43146.9296 / 45007.2 ≈ 0.9587 = 95.87%

### Interpretation

The coefficient of determination, r<sup>2</sup>, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

In this case, an R<sup>2</sup> value of 95.87% indicates that 95.87% of the total variation in the number of books can be explained by the linear model involving the time in months. This high value suggests a strong linear relationship between the number of books and the time in months.
