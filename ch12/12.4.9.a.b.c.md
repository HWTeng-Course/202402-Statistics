a. The r^2 value of 0.027 indicates that only about 2.7% of the variance in price can be explained by the linear relationship with screen size. In other words, the linear regression model with screen size as the independent variable does not effectively predict or explain the variation in prices.

b. The residuals are evenly distributed on the versus fit plot. If we trace the dots above 0 and below 0, it suggests that the assumption of equal variance may not be violated. The points on the plot doesn't deviate significantly from a straight line, which doesn't indicate non-normality in the residuals. 

c.
