### Question
![圖1](https://github.com/HWTeng-Course/202402-Statistics/blob/eb3fbf99d3eeec2c2b8e4d4a39a6dc7fbacc5367/Images/S__3072024.jpg)

### Solution 
### a.

  $S_{xx} = \sum_{i=1}^{} x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2 = 2212178 - \frac{5028^2}{12} = 105446$<br>
  $S_{yy} = \sum_{i=1}^{} y_i^2 - n\bar{y}^2 = 1233987 - \frac{5028 \times 2856}{12} = 44154$<br>
  $S_{xy} = \sum_{i=1}^{} x_i y_i - n\bar{x}\bar{y} = 723882 - \frac{2856^2}{12} = 37323$<br>
Correlation coeficient, 
  $$r = \frac{S_{xy}}{\sqrt{S_{xx}S_{yy}}\} = \frac{37323}{\sqrt{105446 \times 44154}\} = 0.547$$<br>

We set up<br>
$H_0:ρ=0$\
$H_a:ρ>0$
  $$T = r \times \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-{r}^2}} = 0.5469 \times \sqrt{\frac{10 - 2}{1-0.5469^2}} = 2.0657\approx t_{n-2}$$<br>
According to t-distribution table, $t_{10;0.05}$ = 1.812. Since T = 2.0657 > 1.812, we reject H<sub>0</sub>. Hence the data suggests significant positive correlation between x and y. Therefore, if a racquet has bending stiffness, it is likely to have twisting stiffness.

### b.

From part (a), r = 0.547. Hence, the coefficient of determination, $r^2 = 0.547^2 = 0.2992.$<br>
The coefficient of determination measures the proportion of variation between the variables that is explained by the least squares regression model. Therefore, 29.92% of variability between x and y is explained by the linear model. Since the value here is small, it suggests that a linear least square line doesn't fir the data very well.
