## Solution

### a.

We can see that there is a slight curvature in the picture. So we can say that maybe there is another pattern visible beside linear relationship

### b.
$r^2 = 0.9574 = 95.74%

We can say that 95.74% of the variation between square feet and price is explained by the linear model between the variable.

### c.

There is a significant curvature in the residual plot, so we can say the relationship between price and square feet is not linear.
