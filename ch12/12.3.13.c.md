## Solution

Given:
- Total Sum of Squares (SS<sub>Total</sub>) = 45007.2
- Regression Sum of Squares (SSR) = 43146.9296

### The Coefficient of Determination (r<sup>2</sup>)

The coefficient of determination is calculated as the ratio of SSR to SS<sub>Total</sub>:

- r<sup>2</sup> = SSR / SS<sub>Total</sub> = 43146.9296 / 45007.2 â‰ˆ 0.9587 = 95.87%

### Interpretation

The coefficient of determination, r<sup>2</sup>, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

In this case, an r<sup>2</sup> value of 95.87% indicates that 95.87% of the total variation in the number of books can be explained by the linear model involving the time in months. This high value suggests a strong linear relationship between the number of books and the time in months.
