Given:
- Total Sum of Squares = 45007.2
- Regression Sum of Squares = 43146.9296

The coefficient of determination is calculated as the ratio of SSR to SS<sub>Total</sub>:

- r<sup>2</sup> = SSR / SS<sub>Total</sub> = 43146.9296 / 45007.2 ≈ 0.9587 = 95.87%

The coefficient of determination, r<sup>2</sup>, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

In this case, an r<sup>2</sup> value of 95.87% indicates that 95.87% of the total variation in the number of books can be explained by the linear model involving the time in months. This high value suggests a strong linear relationship between the number of books and the time in months.

Yes

x is on the horizontal axis and y is on the vertical axis.

since we reject the claim that β=0 in part (a) and since r<sup>2</sup>=95.87%
r<sup>2</sup>=95.87% is very high (close to 100%), the model appears to be a good fit for the data

No

I think this line roughly corresponds to the points, so I don't think there's any violation of assumptions.

Note: The points actually show a curvilinear rather than a linear pattern, but your reason is reasonably sufficient, too. Nice work!
