## Solution
Assumption of Linear Regression:

$\ y = α + βx + ε\$

1.Random error terms ε are independent.  
2.For any value of x, random error terms ε have the same normal distribution.  
3.E($ε_i$) = 0 , Var($ε_i$) = $σ^2$   

$r_i$ = $y_i$ - $\hat{y}_i$ = $y_i$ - a - $bx_i$  
If all assumptions have been met, these residuals should be N(0, $σ^2$).    

From the 1st plot(Normal Probability Plot), we can observe that the points almost lie along the straight line, and are sloping upward to the right. This is in line with the approximate normality assumption of the residuals. Thus, the normality assumption of the residuals is not violated.

From the 2nd plot(Residual vs fitted plot), we can observe that the points below the 0 residual somewhat forms a straight line having unequal vertical spread, this suggests that the variability of the residuals changes across different levels of the independent variable x. As a result, it can deviate from the equal variance assumption, since it must show (vertical) random scatter around zero with a constant spread of residuals and no discernible pattern or trend if equal variance assumption is valid.

CONCLUSION:
1. Straight line with slope upward, normality assumption is preserved.
2. Residual plot shows pattern with points having different vertical spread for different values of $\hat{y}$, violating the constant variance assumption.

## Teng's comments

Suggested Answers
1. Most points are around the straight line, so normality is satisfied.
2. (1) Constant zero mean. (2) But, variance seems to spread out.
