## Solution

From the 1st plot, which is the Normal Probability Plot, we can observe that the points almost lie along the straight line with a slight exception being the 1st and the last 2 points, and are sloping upward. This is in line with the approximate normality assumption of the residuals. Thus, the normality assumption of the residuals is not violated.

From the Residual vs fitted plot(2nd plot), it must be free of any pattern, with the points appearing as randomly scattered around 0, (which is the mean of the residuals) on the vertical axis with approximately the same spread (vertical) for all fitted values of y. Here, we can observe that the points below the 0 residual somewhat forms a straight line having unequal vertical spread (fanning out pattern). As a result it can deviate from the equal variance assumption or homoscedasticity.

CONCLUSION:
1. Straight line with slope outward, normality assumption is preserved.
2. Residual plot shows pattern with points having different vertical spread for different values of $\hat{y}$, thus showing fanning out pattern, violating the constant variance assumption.
