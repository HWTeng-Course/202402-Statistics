### Solution 
### a.

Observing the regression line on the graph, we can see that only a few points are not on the regression line, so we can say that the assumption of linearity appear to be reasonable.
### b.
The equation of the regression line used for predicting final exam score as a function of the end-of-semester survey score is $y =-26.8+1.262x $.
### c.

*Step 1*

$H_0$ : The model is not useful in predicting y vs $H_1$ : The model is useful in predicting y

*Step 2*

Set α = 0.01

*Step 3*

$F_{STAT} = \frac{MSR}{MSE}  \sim  F_{1,(n-2)}$

*Step 4*

$F^* = \frac{3254.03}{58.05} = 56.05 $

*Step 5*

p-value=0.000 < 0.01

*Step 6*

$\because p-value< α = 0.01 $<br>
$\therefore we &ensp; reject &ensp; H_0$<br>
There is sufficient evidence that final exam score is linearly related to the end-of-semester survey score. 

### d.
99%C.I.=b $\pm t_{0.005;n-2} \sqrt{ \frac{MSE}{S_{xx}} }$<br>
=1.262 $\pm t_{0.005;18} \sqrt{ \frac{58.05}{2044} }$<br>
=[ $1.262-2.878 \times 0.169 , 1.262+2.878 \times 0.169$ ](calculated by excel)<br>
=[ 0.776 , 1.748 ]<br>
