Find the Upper 95%

95%C.I.=b $\pm t_{n-2;0.025} \sqrt{ \frac{MSE}{S_{xx}} }$<br>
=-1.251 $\pm t_{5;0.025} \sqrt{ \frac{9.99}{700} }$<br>
=[ $-1.251-2.571 \times 0.11946 , -1.251+2.571 \times 0.11946$ ]<br>
=[-1.5581 , -0.94387 ]

This means we can be 95% confident that the true slope of the line falls within the interval [-1.559 , -0.94387 ]

### d.
According to the provided output, the coefficient of determination, R Square = 0.9564

The coefficient of determination (R Square) indicates that 95.64% of the variation in the percentage arrested can be explained by the linear relationship with the group median age. 

This means that the group median age is a strong predictor of the percentage arrested.
