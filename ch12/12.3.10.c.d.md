### Solution
### c. 
According to the provided output: Slope (b) = -1.251, Standard error = 0.120

The 95% confidence interval for the slope is given as: Lower 95% = -1.559, Upper 95% = -0.943 

This means we can be 95% confident that the true slope of the line falls within the interval [-1.559, -0.943]

### d.
According to the provided output: the coefficient of determination, R Square, = 0.9564

The coefficient of determination (R Square) indicates that 95.64% of the variation in the percentage arrested can be explained by the linear relationship with the group median age. 

This means that the group median age is a strong predictor of the percentage arrested.
