a. The random error ε must have a normal distribution with mean 0 and a common variance σ^2, independent of x.  
b. The best estimate of variance is MSE = 58.05.  
c. The normal probability plot shows a slight deviation from normality in the tails of the distribution. The residual plot may have one unusual observation (upper left), but there do not appear to be any extreme violations of the regression assumptions
