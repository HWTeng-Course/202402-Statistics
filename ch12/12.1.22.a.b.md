There is a positive relationship between armspan and height. As armspan increases, height also tends to increase.

## Question b

regression line =>let $y = \beta x + \alpha $<br>\
slope of the regression line => $b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$\
$S_{xx} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(x_i - \bar{x})$\
$S_{xy} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$\
If da Vinci is correct, the slope of the regression line should be close to 1, because armspan and height are nearly equal on average.
