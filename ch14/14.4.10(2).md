## Solution

Because three hundred adults were selected in each category, we have a contingency table with fixed columns. The table, with estimated expected cell counts appearing in parentheses, follows.

|               |Bachelors or higher|Some college|High school or less |Total   |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|--------------------|--------|
|Improved       |187(166)           |162(166)    |149(166)            |498     |
|Not improved   |113(134)           |138(134)    |151(134)            |402     |
|Total          |300                |300         |300                 |900     |

 $\alpha$ = 0.01\
The test statistic : 

$X^{2}=\frac{{(187-166)}^2}{166}+\frac{{(162-166)}^2}{166}+\frac{{(149-166)}^2}{166}+\frac{{(113-134)}^2}{134}+\frac{{(138-134)}^2}{134}+\frac{{(151-134)}^2}{134}$
      =10.061  with df = (2-1)(3-1) = 2
