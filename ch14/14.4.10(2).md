## Solution

Step 1.\
H<sub>0</sub> : Marriage rates are relatively similar across adults in these educational levels.\
H<sub>a</sub> : Marriage rates differ significantly among adults in these aducationl levels.

Step 2.\
 $\alpha$ = 0.01\
The test statistic : 
$X^2$ = $\sum$ $\frac{\displaystyle(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$ $\approx X^2_{(r-1)(c-1)}$

Step 3.\
Because three hundred adults were selected in each category, we have a contingency table with fixed columns. The table, with estimated expected cell counts appearing in parentheses, follows.

|               |Bachelors or higher|Some college|High school or less |Total   |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|--------------------|--------|
|Married        |187(166)           |162(166)    |149(166)            |498     |
|Not married    |113(134)           |138(134)    |151(134)            |402     |
|Total          |300                |300         |300                 |900     |

|$\hat{E}$     |Bachelors or higher  |Some college | High school or less|
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|--------------------|
|Married       |$\frac{300*498}{900}$ =166 |$\frac{300*498}{900}$ =166 |$\frac{300*498}{900}$ =166 |
|Not married   |$\frac{300*402}{900}$ =134 |$\frac{300*402}{900}$ =134 |$\frac{300*402}{900}$ =134 |

Step 4.\
The realized test statistic : \
$X^{2}=\frac{{(187-166)}^2}{166}+\frac{{(162-166)}^2}{166}+\frac{{(149-166)}^2}{166}+\frac{{(113-134)}^2}{134}+\frac{{(138-134)}^2}{134}+\frac{{(151-134)}^2}{134}$
      =10.061  with df = (2-1)(3-1) = 2
      
Step 5.\
 $X^2_{2;0,01}$=9.21\
The rejection region with 2 df is $X^{2}>9.21.\
 H<sub>0</sub> is rejected and we conclude that marriage rates differ significantly among adults in these educational levels.
