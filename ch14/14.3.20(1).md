## Solution
Step1 \
$H_0$ : gender and amount spent on car are independent \
$H_a$ : gender and amount spent on car are dependent

Step2 \
Set $\alpha$ = 0.05

Step3 \
| Gender / Spending    | None or Only a Little | Some | About Half | Most | Almost All |
|----------------------|-----------------------|------|------------|------|------------|
| Male                 | 65.0                  | 13.5 | 8.5        | 6.5  | 4.5        |
| Female               | 65.0                  | 13.5 | 8.5        | 6.5  | 4.5        |

###  (χ²)
Test statisic: $X^2_{STAT}$ = $\sum$ $\frac{\displaystyle(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$ \
計算出的卡方統計量是 6.696。

Step4 \
accroding to pearson chi square test, p-value is 0.153

Step5 

$\alpha$ < p-value, do not reject $H_0$

Step6 \
$H_0$ is not rejected, and the results are declared non-significant. There is insufficient evidence to indicate a difference in spending patterns between males and females.

Since significant differences were not found, there is no need to describe the differences.
