### Solution

### Step 1
$H_0$: There is no association between variable A and B ( $ρ_s$=0 ) <br>
$H_a$: There is an association between variable A and B ( $ρ_s$ $\neq$ 0 )

### Step 2
Set $\alpha$ = 0.05
   
### Step 3
Test statistic:

$$
  r_{s, \text{STAT}} = 1 - \frac{6 \sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}
$$

### Step 4
Rank the values of A and B and the differences of A minus B.

| |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|A|2|1|4|6|5|3|
|B|5|6|3|1|2|4|
|d|-3|-5|1|5|3|-1|
|d^2|9|25|1|25|9|1|


Realized Statistic :

$$
r^* = 1 - \frac{6 \times (9 + 25 + 1 + 25 + 9 + 1)}{6 \times (36 - 1)} = -1
$$

### Step 5
The critical value of $r$ with n=6 and $\alpha = 0.05$ is -0.829.<br>
Rejection Region = { r : r<= -0.829} <br>

### Step 6
Conclude: 
Since -1 < -0.829, we can reject $H_0$. <br>
There is sufficient evidence to indicate tahat there is an association between variable A and B (negative association).
