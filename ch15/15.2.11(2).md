1 .
 H<sub>0</sub>: the rating distributions are the same (p = 0.5)

 &emsp;
 H<sub>1</sub>: the ratings are different (p $\neq$ 0.5)   with n = 20 (omit the tired pairs)

2 . set $\alpha$ = 0.05

3 . Test statistic = x = number of plus signs (+)

4 . Realized statistic: x<sup>#</sup> = 11

5 . Use Table 1 with n = 20 and p = 0.5

Because this is a two-tailed test, we look for the critical values where the cumulative probability is $\alpha$/2 = 0.025

By the table, we can get the critical values are 5 (lower) and 14 (upper)

**
The rejection region: {x &le; 5 or x &ge; 14}**

6 . Because 11 &notin; the rejection region, H<sub>0</sub> does not be rejected. There is not sufficient evidence to indicate that one of the chefs tends to give higher ratings than the other.

## (b)

1 .
 H<sub>0</sub>: the rating distributions are the same (p = 0.5)

 &emsp;
 H<sub>1</sub>: the ratings are different (p $\neq$ 0.5)   with n = 20 (omit the tired pairs)

2 . set $\alpha$ = 0.05

3 . The test statistic

 &emsp;
     $Z_{STAT}$ = $\frac{{x}-0.5{n}}{0.5\sqrt{n}}\sim Z$ 

4 . The realized test statistic

 &emsp;
     $Z^*=\frac{11-10}{0.5\sqrt{20}}=0.447213595\approx0.4472$

5 . For a two-tailed test,the rejection region is{z : |z| > 1.96}(5% level).

6 . Because 0.4472 &notin; the rejection region, H<sub>0</sub> does not be rejected. There is not sufficient evidence to indicate that one of the chefs tends to give higher ratings than the other.

## (c)

The results of the two parts are that H<sub>0</sub> does not be rejected, and the results of the two tests are the same.
