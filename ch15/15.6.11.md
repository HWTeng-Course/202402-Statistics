## Solution

### Part a
- $H0$ : There isn't different in the yields for five different varieties
- $Ha$ : There is different in the yields for five different varieties
- $\alpha$ = 0.05
- Test statistic and its distribution

$$
F_{r,\text{STAT}} = \frac{12}{bk(k+1)} \left( \sum_{i=1}^k T_i^2 \right) - 3b(k+1)
$$

- Rank Table
| Variety \ Block |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 | $T_i$ |
| :-------------: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|        A        |  4  |  2  |  3  |  3  |  3  |  3  |  18  |
|        B        |  1  |  3  |  2  |  2  |  2  |  2  |  12  |
|        C        |  5  |  4  |  4  |  4  |  4  |  5  |  26  |
|        D        |  3  |  5  |  5  |  5  |  5  |  4  |  27  |
|        E        |  2  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |   7  |

- Calculate $F_r^{\ast}$
  
$$
F_r^{\ast} = \frac{12}{6 \cdot 5 \cdot (5+1)} \left( 17^2 + 12^2 + 26^2 + 28^2 + 7^2 \right) - 3 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 = 21.466
$$

- Right-tail test
  $$X^2_{5-1,0.05} = 9.487$$

- So reject $H0$ if $F_r^{\ast} \geq 9.487$
- Since $21.466 > 9.487$
- Reject $H0$
- There is different in the yields for five different varieties

### Part b
The ANOVA F-test produced test statistic $F = 18.61$ and p-value close to 0 , which also indicate significant differences among the wheat varieties.

In conclusion, the Friedman test confirms the findings of the ANOVA, providing additional confidence in the results indicating significant differences in wheat variety yields.
