## Solution

### (a)

The ranks of the sample observations for the four locations are presented in the following table.

| Location 1 | Ranking | Location 2 | Ranking | Location 3 | Ranking | Location 4 | Ranking |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 5.7        | 15.5    | 6.2        | 22.5    | 5.4        | 12      | 3.7        | 4       |
| 6.3        | 24      | 5.3        | 11      | 5.0        | 8       | 3.2        | 1       |
| 6.1        | 21      | 5.7        | 15.5    | 6.0        | 19      | 3.9        | 5       |
| 6.0        | 19      | 6.0        | 19      | 5.6        | 14      | 4.0        | 6       |
| 5.8        | 17      | 5.2        | 9.5     | 4.9        | 7       | 3.5        | 2       |
| 6.2        | 22.5    | 5.5        | 13      | 5.2        | 9.5     | 3.6        | 3       |

#### 1. Null Hypothesis V.S Alternative Hypothesis

 $H_0 :$ The 4 population distributions for each of the swampy sites are the same. 

 $H_a :$ At least two of the 4 population distributions differ in location.

 

#### 2. Calculate Rank Sums

 $T_1 $= Sums of the ranks of location 1 = 15.5 + 24 + 21 + 19 + 17 + 22.5 = 119
 
 $T_2 $= Sums of the ranks of location 2 = 22.5 + 11 + 15.5 + 19 + 9.5 + 13 = 90.5
 
 $T_3 $= Sums of the ranks of location 3 = 12 + 8 + 19 + 14 + 7 + 9.5 = 69.5
 
 $T_4 $= Sums of the ranks of location 4 = 4 + 1 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 3 = 21

 

#### 3. Calculate the Test Statistic & Determine the Rejection Region

The calculation of the Kruskal-Wallis test statistic is shown below.

$H = \frac{12}{n(n+1)} \left( \frac{T_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{T_2^2}{n_2} + \frac{T_3^2}{n_3} + \frac{T_4^2}{n_4} \right) - 3(n+1) = \frac{12}{24(24+1)} \left( \frac{(119)^2}{6} + \frac{(90.5)^2}{6} + \frac{(69.5)^2}{6} + \frac{(21)^2}{6} \right) - 3(24+1)= 17.075 $

Given $\alpha&emsp;$=  0.05; df = k - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 (find the critical value from the chi-square distribution)

![image](https://github.com/HWTeng-Course/202402-Statistics/blob/main/Images/stat.jpg?raw=true)

Critical value =>  7.81473, Rejection Region : {H > 7.81473} 



#### 4. Conclusion

Since the test statistic, 17.075, is larger than the cricical value, 7.81473, we reject the null hypothesis.

Conclude that there is sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in location for at least two of the four swampy sites.



### (b)

To find the approximate $p$-value, we examine the table again.

From the table above, we observe that the value 17.075 falls above the value 12.8381 at 3 df. Hence the $p$-value is less than 0.005 

=> $p$-value< 0.005



### (c)

ANOVA $F $-test test statistic: $p$-value = 0.000 < 0.005 < 0.05

Kruskal-Wallis test statistic:  $p$-value < 0.005 < 0.05

The two test results reach the same conclusion to reject the null hypothesis.
