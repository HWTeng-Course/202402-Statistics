## Solution

### (a)

The ranks of the sample observations for the four locations are presented in the following table.

| Location 1 | Ranking | Location 2 | Ranking | Location 3 | Ranking | Location 4 | Ranking |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 5.7        | 15.5    | 6.2        | 22.5    | 5.4        | 12      | 3.7        | 4       |
| 6.3        | 24      | 5.3        | 11      | 5.0        | 8       | 3.2        | 1       |
| 6.1        | 21      | 5.7        | 15.5    | 6.0        | 19      | 3.9        | 5       |
| 6.0        | 19      | 6.0        | 19      | 5.6        | 14      | 4.0        | 6       |
| 5.8        | 17      | 5.2        | 9.5     | 4.9        | 7       | 3.5        | 2       |
| 6.2        | 22.5    | 5.5        | 13      | 5.2        | 9.5     | 3.6        | 3       |

#### 1. Null Hypothesis V.S Alternative Hypothesis

 $H_0 :$ The 4 population distributions for each of the swampy sites are the same. 

 $H_a :$ At least two of the 4 population distributions differ in location.

#### 2. Calculate Rank Sums
