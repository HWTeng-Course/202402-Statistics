![15 5 6](https://github.com/HWTeng-Course/202402-Statistics/assets/170784151/537a76cf-bae9-4139-b91c-67432a324311)

## Solution

### Step 1: Hypotheses Tests and Rank the Data
Given:

-  $\alpha =$ $\text{significance level}$ $= 0.01$
-  $k =$ $\text{number of samples}$ $= 4$

The null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the population distributions. The alternative hypothesis states the opposite of the null hypothesis.

-  $H_0 :$ $\text{The population distributions are the same.}$<br>
-  $H_a :$ $\text{At least two of the population distributions differ in location.}$<br>

Determine the rank of every data value. The smallest value receives the rank 1, the second smallest value receives the rank 2, the third smallest value receives the rank 3, and so on. If multiple data values have the same value, then their rank is the average of the corresponding ranks.

| 0.5      | Rank     | 1.0      | Rank     | 1.5      | Rank     |2.0       | Rank     |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 8        | 13       | 9        | 16       | 4        | 2        | 4        | 2        |
| 14       | 20       | 7        | 10       | 6        | 7.5      | 7        | 10       |
| 9        | 16       | 5        | 5        | 7        | 10       | 5        | 5        |
| 12       | 19       | 8        | 13       | 8        | 13       | 5        | 5        |
| 10       | 18       | 9        | 16       | 6        | 7.5      | 4        | 2        |
| $T_1$    | 86       | $T_2$    | 60       | $T_3$    | 40       | $T_4$    | 24       |

### Step 2: Calculate the Test Statistic

Determine the value of the Kruskal-Wallis test statistic:

$$
H = \left( \frac{12}{n(n+1)} \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{T_i^2}{n_i} \right) - 3(n + 1) = \frac{12}{20(20+1)} \left( \frac{86^2}{5} + \frac{60^2}{5} + \frac{40^2}{5} + \frac{24^2}{5} \right) - 3(20+1) \approx 12.2686
$$

</div>

The P-value is the probability of obtaining the value of the test statistic, or a value more extreme. The P-value is the number (or interval) in the column title of the chi-square distribution table in the appendix containing the $\chi^2$ - value in the row **$df = k - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3$**:

$$
0.05 < P < 0.10
$$

If the P-value is **less than or equal to the significance level**, then the null hypothesis is rejected:

$$
P > 0.01 \Rightarrow \text{ do not reject } H_0
$$

There is not sufficient evidence to support the claim that there is a difference in the distribution of times for the four difference lengths of instructional time.

### Step 3: Conclusion

**Rejection region for a given $\alpha$: $H$ > $\chi^2_{0.01}$ $with$ $df = (4 - 1)$ $\Rightarrow$ $H c 11.3449$**

$\because\quad$ $H = 12.2686$ and $12.2686 > 11.3449$<br>
$\therefore\quad$ $\text{ reject } H_0$<br>

There is **not** sufficient evidence to support the claim that there is a difference in the distribution of times for the four difference lengths of instructional time.
