| A            | B              | Difference          | Sign           |
| ------------ | -------------  | ------------------- | -------------- | 
| 5            | 7              | 5-7=-2              | -              |
| 6            | 5              | 6-5= 1              | +              |
| 8            | 9              | 8-9=-1              | -              |
| 4            | 5              | 4-5=-1              | -              |
| 9            | 9              | 9-9= 0              | X              |
| 3            | 5              | 3-5=-2              | -              |
| 7            | 6              | 7-6= 1              | +              |
| 8            | 8              | 8-8= 0              | X              |
| 8            | 9              | 8-9=-1              | -              |
| 9            | 10             | 9-10=-1             | -              |

1 .

 $H_{0}$ : Distributions of ratings received by two tenderizers are same.($p=0.5$)
 
 $H_{a}$ : Distributions of ratings received by two tenderizers are different.($p\neq0.5$)

2 . set $\alpha = 0.05&emsp;n=10-2=8$

3 . Test statistic and its distribution:  $X\sim Bin(8,0.5)$

4 . The observed value of the test statistic is the number of "plus" signs in the table.   $X^{*}=2$

5 . Calculate the p-value :

${p-value} = 2P(X \leq 2)=2*[P(X = 0)+P(X = 1)+P(X = 2)]$

$P(X = 0) = C_{0}^{8} (0.5)^0(0.5)^8 = 0.00390625$

$P(X = 1) = C_{1}^{8} (0.5)^1(0.5)^7 = 0.03125$

$P(X = 2) = C_{2}^{8} (0.5)^2(0.5)^6 = 0.109375$

${p-value} = 2P(X \leq 2)=2*(0.00390625+0.03125+0.109375)=0.2890625\approx0.29$


6 . Conclusion:

Since the $p-value=0.29 > 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_0$ at $\alpha\ = 0.05$

There is not sufficient evidence to indicate that the distributions of ratings received by two tenderizers are different.

### Normal probability plot

The data values are on the horizontal axis and the standardized normal scores are on the vertical axis.
If the data contains n data values, then the standardized normal scores are the z-scores in the normal probability table of the appendix corresponding to an area of $\frac{j-0.5}{n}\$ (or the closet area) with $j \in \lbrace 1,2,3,...,n\rbrace$.

The smallest standardized score corresponds with the smallest data value, the second smallest standardized score corresponds with the second smallest data value, and so on.

If the pattern in the normal probability plot is roughly linear, then it is appropriate to assume that the data come from a population with a normal distribution.

The above normal probability does not show strong curvature nor outliers, thus it is appropriate to assume that the data come from a population with a normal distribution and thus it is also appropriate to analyze the data using a Student's t-test.
