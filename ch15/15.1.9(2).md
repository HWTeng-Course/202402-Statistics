## Solution

  Given sample size of:
-  $n_1 = 5$
-  $n_2 = 7$

### Step 1: Hypothesis Test

Hypothesis test<br>
- $H_0$: distributions of different experience are equal<br>
- $H_a$: the distribution of substantial experience is on the right of the distribution of limited experience <br>
- Since the question is asking whether experience is a prime factor for selecting the best candidates, doing a one tailed test is appropriate.<br>

### Step 2: Set $\alpha$ value
significance level $\alpha$ = 0.05

### Step 3: Set test statistics $T_1$ and $T_1*$
Values in the Observation row:
- 1 represents "substantial experience"
- 2 represents "limited experience"
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Observation</td>
    <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td>
    <td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td>
    <td>2</td><td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rank</td>
    <td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td>
    <td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td>
    <td>11</td><td>12</td>
  </tr>
</table>

$T_1 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 = 19$ <br>
$T_1* = 5 * (5 + 7 + 1) - 19 = 46$ <br>
$T = min(T_1, T_1*)$ <br>

### Step 4: Calculate the realized statistic $T$
$T = min(T_1, T_1*) = T_1 = 19$ <br>

### Step 5: Check the table for Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, $n_1 \leq n_2$ and develop rejection region
The critical value of $T$ for one tailed test with $\alpha = 0.05$ is $T = 21$.<br> 
=> reject $H_0$ if $T \leq 21$.<br><br>

### Step 6: Conclusion
Since $19 ∈ RR$, $H_0$ will be rejected.<br>
=> the distribution of substantial experience is on the right of the distribution of limited experience,<br>
suggesting that experience is a prime factor in the selection of the best candidates.<br>
