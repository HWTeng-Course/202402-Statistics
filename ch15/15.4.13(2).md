## Solution

## (a)

- Calculate the difference of  accident rates between both traffic control method $(d = x_1 - x_2)$
(note: $d = 0$ must be ignored)

    The difference and sign for each intersection are shown in the table below :
    
    | Intersection | A $(x_1)$ | B $(x_2)$ | Difference $(d = x_1 - x_2)$ | Sign |
    | :----------: | :-------: | :-------: | :--------------------------: | :--: |
    | 1            | 5         | 4         | 1                            | +    |
    | 2            | 6         | 4         | 2                            | +    |
    | 3            | 8         | 9         | -1                           | -    |
    | 4            | 3         | 2         | 1                            | +    |
    | 5            | 6         | 3         | 3                            | +    |
    | 6            | 1         | 0         | 1                            | +    |
    | 7            | 2         | 3         | -1                           | -    |
    | 8            | 4         | 1         | 3                            | +    |
    | 9            | 7         | 9         | -2                           | -    |
    | 10           | 5         | 2         | 3                            | +    |
    | 11           | 6         | 5         | 1                            | +    |
    | 12           | 1         | 1         | 0                            |      |

- Summary:
  - Positive differences $(\+\)$: 8
  - Negative differences $(\-\)$: 3
  - Ties: 1
---

1. $H_0$ : There is no difference between the two population distributions. <br>
   $H_a$ : There is a difference between the two population distributions.

2. set $\alpha = 0.05 $

3. Test statistic = T = sum of plus signs (+) 

4. Realized statistic: $T^* = 8 $

5. Use this table with $n = 11 \text{ and } p = 0.5 $

Because this is a two-tailed test, $\ p\text{-value} = 2 P(X \geq 8 \mid n = 11, p = 0.5)$

By the table, we can get the $\ p\text{-value} = 2(1 - 0.887) = 2 * 0.113 = 0.226$

- Conclusion <br>
  $\because \ p\text{-value} = 0.226 > 0.05 $<br>
  $\therefore \text{ Do not reject } H_0$ <br>
  There is insufficient evidence to indicate a difference in the distributions of accident rates for traffic control methods A and B.


## (b)
- rank the absolute values of the differences from smallest to the largest
  
    The difference and sign for each intersection are shown in the table below :
    
    | Intersection | A $(x_1)$ | B $(x_2)$ | Difference $(d = x_1 - x_2)$ | Rank | Signed Rank  |
    | :----------: | :-------: | :-------: | :--------------------------: | :--: | :----------: |
    | 1            | 5         | 4         | 1                            | 3.5  | + 3.5        |
    | 2            | 6         | 4         | 2                            | 7.5  | + 7.5        |
    | 3            | 8         | 9         | -1                           | 3.5  | - 3.5        |
    | 4            | 3         | 2         | 1                            | 3.5  | + 3.5        |
    | 5            | 6         | 3         | 3                            | 10   | + 10         |
    | 6            | 1         | 0         | 1                            | 3.5  | + 3.5        |
    | 7            | 2         | 3         | -1                           | 3.5  | - 3.5        |
    | 8            | 4         | 1         | 3                            | 10   | + 10         |
    | 9            | 7         | 9         | -2                           | 7.5  | - 7.5        |
    | 10           | 5         | 2         | 3                            | 10   | + 10         |
    | 11           | 6         | 5         | 1                            | 3.5  | + 3.5        |
    | 12           | 1         | 1         | 0                            |      |              |

  
1. $H_0$ : There is no difference between the two population distributions. <br>
   $H_a$ : There is a difference between the two population distributions.

2. set $\alpha$ = 0.05

3. Calculate the rank sum for the negative differences $(T^-)$ and positive differences $(T^+)$ <br>
$T^+ = 3.5 + 7.5 + 3.5 + 10 + 3.5 + 10 + 10 + 3.5 = 51.5$ <br>
$T^- = 3.5 + 3.5 + 7.5 = 14.5$ <br>
$\therefore$ Test Statistic $(T^*) = min(T^+,\ \ T^-) = min(51.5,\ \ 14.5)= 14.5$ 

4. Find critical values and rejection region by using this table <br>
   ⇒ two-tailed test with $\alpha = 0.05$ and $n = 12 - 1 = 11$

   As shown from the picture above, $T_0$ $= 11$ ⇒ rejection region $`= \{T \leq 11\}`$

5. Conclusion <br>
   $\because T^* = 14.5 \notin$ rejection region $`= \{T \leq 11\}`$ <br>
   $\therefore \text{ Do not reject } H_0$ <br>
   There is insufficient evidence to indicate a difference in the distributions of accident rates for traffic control methods A and B.
