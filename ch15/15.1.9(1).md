## Solution

Step 1. H<sub>0</sub>: Rank of limit experience's medium = Rank of substantial experience's medium  
&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;H<sub>a</sub>: Rank of limit experience's medium ≠ Rank of substantial experience's medium 

Step 2. Set  $\alpha=0.05$

Step 3. Set the group with a smaller number of samples be n1.  
&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hence, n1=5 , n2=7  
&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;T<sub>1</sub>=1+2+3+5+8=19  
&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;T*=5(5+7+1)-19=46  
&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;T=min(T<sub>1</sub>,T*)  

Step 4. T=min(T<sub>1</sub>,T*)=min(19,46)=19  

Step 5. 查表

The critical value of T from table 7(b) for two tailed test with $\alpha$/2=0.025 is T=20; H<sub>0</sub> is rejected if T &le; 20.  

Step 6. Conclude  
&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Because 19 &in; the rejection region, H<sub>0</sub> will be rejected.  
&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This indicates that there is a significant difference between the rankings of applicants with limited experience  
&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and those with substantial experience, suggesting that experience is a prime factor in the selection of the best  
&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;candidates.
