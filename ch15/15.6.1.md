## Answer

#### Rank table:
- |  block \ Trate |  T1  |  T2  |  T3  |
  | :----------: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
  | 1            | 3   | 2   | 1   |
  | 2            | 2   | 3   | 1   |
  | 3            | 2   | 3   | 1   |
  | 4            | 1   | 3   | 2   |
  | 5            | 2   | 3   | 1   |
  | 6            | 2.5 | 2.5 | 1   |
  |$T_i$         | 12.5| 16.5| 7   |

#### Step1:
- $H_0$: There are no differences in location among the treatment distributions.
- $H_a$: At least one treatment distribution differs in location from the others.

#### Step  2 :  Set $\alpha$
- $\alpha$ = 0.05 

#### Step  3 :  Test Statistic
$$
F_{r,\text{STAT}} = \frac{12}{bk(k+1)} \left( \sum_{i=1}^k T_i^2 \right) - 3b(k+1)
$$

#### Step  4 :  Realized Statistic
- Calculate $F_r^{\ast}$
  
$$
F_r^{\ast} = \frac{12}{6 \cdot 3 \cdot (3+1)} \left( 12.5^2 + 16.5^2 + 7^2 \right) - 3 \cdot 6 \cdot (3+1) = 7.58
$$

#### Step  5 :  p-value
- Search in Chi-Square distribution table  ,  $df$ = 3-1 = 2 <br>
$\because \text{ 7.58 }$ is between $$X^2_{2,0.025} = 7.38$$ and $$X^2_{2,0.01} = 9.21$$
p-value is smaller than 0.025.

#### Step  6 :  Conclusion
- Conclusion :<br>
  $\because \ p\text{-value}   < 0.05 $<br>
  $\therefore \text{ Reject } H_0$<br>
  At least one treatment distribution differs in location from the others.
