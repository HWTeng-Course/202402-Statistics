## Solution

### Part a
- $H0$ : There isn't a difference in the toxic effects of the three chemicals
- $Ha$ : There is a difference in the toxic effects of the three chemicals
- $\alpha$ = 0.05
- Test statistic and its distribution

$$
F_{r,\text{STAT}} = \frac{12}{bk(k+1)} \left( \sum_{i=1}^k T_i^2 \right) - 3b(k+1)
$$

- Calculate $F_r^{\ast}$
  
$$
F_r^{\ast} = \frac{12}{8 \cdot 3 \cdot (3+1)} \left( 14^2 + 21.5^2 + 12.5^2 \right) - 3 \cdot 8 \cdot (3+1) = 5.8125
$$

- Right-tail test
  $$X^2_{3-1,0.05} = 5.138$$

- So reject $H0$ if $F_r^{\ast} \geq 5.138$
- Since $5.8125 > 5.138$
- Reject $H0$
- There is a difference in the toxic effects of the three chemicals

### Part b
The ANOVA F-test produced test statistic $F = 18.61$ and p-value close to 0 , which also indicate significant differences among the wheat varieties.

In conclusion, the Friedman test confirms the findings of the ANOVA, providing additional confidence in the results indicating significant differences in wheat variety yields.
