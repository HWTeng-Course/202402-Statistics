## Solution

### Part a
- $H0$ : There isn't a difference in the toxic effects of the three chemicals
- $Ha$ : There is a difference in the toxic effects of the three chemicals
- $\alpha$ = 0.05
- Rank of each block and Rank sum of different toxic
- |  toxic \ rat |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |   Sum   |  
  | :----------: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |   :-:   |
  | A            | 3   | 2.5 | 2   | 1   | 1   | 1.5 | 2   | 1   |   14    |
  | B            | 2   | 2.5 | 3   | 3   | 2.5 | 3   | 3   | 2.5 |   21.5  | 
  | C            | 1   | 1   | 1   | 2   | 2.5 | 1.5 | 1   | 2.5 |   12.5  |

- Test statistic and its distribution

$$
F_{r,\text{STAT}} = \frac{12}{bk(k+1)} \left( \sum_{i=1}^k T_i^2 \right) - 3b(k+1)
$$

- Calculate $F_r^{\ast}$
  
$$
F_r^{\ast} = \frac{12}{8 \cdot 3 \cdot (3+1)} \left( 14^2 + 21.5^2 + 12.5^2 \right) - 3 \cdot 8 \cdot (3+1) = 5.8125
$$

- Right-tail test
  $$X^2_{3-1,0.05} = 5.138$$

- Rejection Region of $H0$ : { $F_r^{\ast} \geq 5.138$ }
- Since $5.8125 > 5.138$
- Reject $H0$
- There is a difference in the toxic effects of the three chemicals

### Part b
