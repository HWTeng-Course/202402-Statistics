## Solution

### Problem Description
In a study of visual scanning behavior in hearing-impaired children, eye movements were measured in nine hearing-impaired children and nine normally hearing children. The table shows the eye movement rates and their ranks (in parentheses). Can it be concluded that the distributions of eye movement rates are different between hearing-impaired and normally hearing children?

#### Table Data
| Hearing-impaired children | Normally hearing children |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| 2.75 (15)                 | 0.89 (1)                  |
| 2.14 (11)                 | 1.43 (7)                  |
| 3.23 (18)                 | 1.06 (4)                  |
| 2.07 (10)                 | 1.01 (3)                  |
| 2.49 (14)                 | 0.94 (2)                  |
| 2.18 (12)                 | 1.79 (8)                  |
| 3.16 (17)                 | 1.12 (5.5)                |
| 2.93 (16)                 | 2.01 (9)                  |
| 2.20 (13)                 | 1.12 (5.5)                |

| Rank Sum |
|:--------:|
| 126      |
| 45       |

### Step 1: Hypotheses and Ranking
Given:
-  $n_1$ = sample size = 9
-  $n_2$ = sample size = 9
- $\alpha$ = significance level = 0.05

$H_0$ : There is no difference between the two population distributions.

$H_a$ : There is a difference between the two population distributions.

#### Ranking Process
Rank each data value. The smallest value gets rank 1, the second smallest gets rank 2, and so on. If multiple data values have the same value, then their rank is the average of the corresponding ranks.

| First Group Sample | Rank | Second Group Sample | Rank |
|:------------------:|:----:|:-------------------:|:----:|
| 2.75               | 15   | 0.89                | 1    |
| 2.14               | 11   | 1.43                | 7    |
| 3.23               | 18   | 1.06                | 4    |
| 2.07               | 10   | 1.01                | 3    |
| 2.49               | 14   | 0.94                | 2    |
| 2.18               | 12   | 1.79                | 8    |
| 3.16               | 17   | 1.12                | 5.5  |
| 2.93               | 16   | 2.01                | 9    |
| 2.20               | 13   | 1.12                | 5.5  |

### Step 2: Calculation and Conclusion
We use $T_1$ when the test is left-tailed, $T_1^{\ast}$ when the test is right-tailed and $min$( $T_1$ , $T_1^{\ast}$ ) when the test is two-tailed. Since the test is right-tailed, we need to use $T_1^{\ast}$.  

$T_1$ is the sum of ranks for the first group sample:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**$T_1$ = 15 + 11 + 18 + 10 + 14 + 12 + 17 + 16 + 13 = 126**  

Next, we calculate $T_1^{\ast}$:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**$T_1^{\ast}$ = $n_1 (n_1 + n_2 + 1)$ - $T_1$ = 9(9 + 9 - 1) - 126 = 153 - 126 = 27**  

The value of the test statistic is then equal to $min$( $T_1$ , $T_1^{\ast}$ ):  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**$T$ = $min$( $T_1$ , $T_1^{\ast}$ ) = $min$(126, 27) = 27**  

The critical value for the Wilcoxon rank sum test is given in the column $n_1$ = 9 and in the row $n_2$ = 9 of the table of the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test with $\alpha$/2 = 0.025 = 2.5%  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**$T$ = 62**  

The rejection region then contains all values less than or equal to 62.  

If the value of the test statistic is in the rejection region, then we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ .  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; **62 $\leq 27$  $\Longrightarrow$  $Reject$ $H_0$**

**There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that the distributions of eye movement rates between hearing-impaired and normally hearing children are different.**
