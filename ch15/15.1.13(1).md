## Solution

### Step 1: Hypotheses and Ranking
Given:
-  $n_1$ = sample size = 9
-  $n_2$ = sample size = 9
- $\alpha$ = significance level = 0.05

$H_0$ : There is no difference between the two population distributions.

$H_a$ : There is a difference between the two population distributions.

### Step 2: Calculation and Conclusion
$T_1$ is the sum of ranks for the first group sample:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**$T_1$ = 15 + 11 + 18 + 10 + 14 + 12 + 17 + 16 + 13 = 126**  

Next, we calculate $T_1^{\ast}$:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**$T_1^{\ast}$ = $n_1 (n_1 + n_2 + 1)$ - $T_1$ = 9(9 + 9 - 1) - 126 = 153 - 126 = 27**  

The value of the test statistic is then equal to $min$( $T_1$ , $T_1^{\ast}$ ):  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**$T$ = $min$( $T_1$ , $T_1^{\ast}$ ) = $min$(126, 27) = 27**  

The critical value for the Wilcoxon rank sum test is given in the column $n_1$ = 9 and in the row $n_2$ = 9 of the table of the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test with $\alpha$/2 = 0.025 = 2.5%  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**$T$ = 62**  

The rejection region then contains all values less than or equal to 62.  

If the value of the test statistic is in the rejection region, then we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ .  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; **27 $\leq 62$  $\Longrightarrow$  $Reject$ $H_0$**

**There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that the distributions of eye movement rates between hearing-impaired and normally hearing children are different.**
