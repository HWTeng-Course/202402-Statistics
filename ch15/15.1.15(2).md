### Solution

### Step 1: Hypotheses Tests and Rank the Data
Given:
-  $n_1$ = sample size = 10
-  $n_2$ = sample size = 8
- $\alpha$ = significance level = 0.05

$H_0$ : Distributions of weights for the tagged turtles exposed to the two lake environment are equal.

$H_a$ : Distributions of weights for the tagged turtles exposed to the two lake environment are different.

Combine the weight data from both lakes and rank them from smallest to largest. In the case of ties, assign the average rank to each tied value.
-   Lake 1 weights: 399, 430, 394, 411, 416, 391, 396, 456, 360, 433
-   Lake 2 weights: 345, 368, 399, 385, 351, 337, 354, 391

Combined weights: 337, 345, 351, 354, 360, 368, 385, 391, 391, 394, 396, 399, 399, 411, 416, 430, 433, 456
Rank each value:

| Weight(Lake) | Rank      |
|--------------|-----------|
| 337 (2)      | 1         |
| 345 (2)      | 2         |
| 351 (2)      | 3         |
| 354 (2)      | 4         |
| 360 (1)      | 5         |
| 368 (2)      | 6         |
| 385 (2)      | 7         |
| 391 (1)      | 8.5       |
| 391 (2)      | 8.5       |
| 394 (1)      | 10        |
| 396 (1)      | 11        |
| 399 (1)      | 12.5      |
| 399 (2)      | 12.5      |
| 411 (1)      | 14        |
| 416 (1)      | 15        |
| 430 (1)      | 16        |
| 433 (1)      | 17        |
| 456 (1)      | 18        |

### Step 2: Calculate Rank Sums

Separate the ranks back into the two groups (Lake 1 and Lake 2) and calculate the sum of ranks for each group.

-   Lake 1 ranks: 12.5, 16, 10, 14, 15, 8.5, 11, 18, 5, 17
-   Lake 2 ranks: 2, 6, 12.5, 7, 3, 1, 4, 8.5

Sum of ranks for Lake 1:
12.5 + 16 + 10 + 14 + 15 + 8.5 + 11 + 18 + 5 + 17 = 127

Sum of ranks for Lake 2:
2 + 6 + 12.5 + 7 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 8.5 = 44

### Step 3: Calculate the Test Statistic 

$T_1$ = 2 + 6 + 12.5 + 7 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 8.5  = 44 ($n_2$ < $n_1$)

$T_1^*$ = 8 x (8 + 10 + 1) - 44 = 108

$T$ = min($T_1$, $T_1^*$) = 44 

### Step 4 Conclusion:

<br>

Rejection Region: $Tstat$ < 53 

$T$ = 44 < 53, reject $H_0$.

The data provide sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in the distributions of weights for the tagged turtles exposed to the two lake environments at α = 0.05.
