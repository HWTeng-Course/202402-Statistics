## Solution
- sample 1 --> Alex Smith / sample 2 --> Joe Flacco  
- n<sub>1</sub> is the number of the observations from sample 1 / n<sub>2</sub> is the number of the observations from sample 2  
- Because n<sub>1</sub> = 15 is smaller than n<sub>2</sub> = 16, we choose sample 1 to calculate test statistic.  
1. H<sub>0</sub>: The population distributions for the number of completed passes are identical.
   
   H<sub>1</sub>: Two population distributions for the number of completed passes differ for the two quarter-backs.

2. set $\alpha$ = 0.05

3. | the number of completed passes | sample | rank |

   | 34                             | 2      | 31   |
   
   - T<sub>1</sub> = 4+5+7+7+10+12+15+15+20+20+20+25+25+27+28.5 = 240.5  
   - $\mu_{T}$ = n<sub>1</sub>(n<sub>1</sub>+n<sub>2</sub>+1)/2 = $\frac{15(15+16+1)}{2} = 240 $  
   - $\sigma_{T}^2$ = n<sub>1</sub>n<sub>2</sub>(n<sub>1</sub>+n<sub>2</sub>+1)/12 = $\frac{15*16(15+16+1)}{12} = 640 $  
   - The test statisiic  
     $Z_{STAT}$ = $\frac{{T}-{\mu_{T}}}{{\sigma_{T}}}\sim Z$
   
5. The realized test statistic  
   $Z^* = \frac{240.5-240}{\sqrt{640}} \approx 0.01976$

6. For the two-tailed test, the rejection region : {Z : |Z| > Z<sub>0.025</sub> = 1.96}

7. Because 0.01976 &notin; the rejection region, H<sub>0</sub> is not be rejected.  
   In conclution, two population distributions for the number of completed passes have no significant difference.
