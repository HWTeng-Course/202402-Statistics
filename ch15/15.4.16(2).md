| Brisket            | 4          | 5          | -1               | 3.5         | -           |
| Club steak         | 9          | 9          |  0               | -           | 0           |
| Round steak        | 3          | 5          | -2               | 7.5         | -           |
| Rump roast         | 7          | 6          |  1               | 3.5         | +           |
| Sirloin steak      | 8          | 8          |  0               | -           | 0           |
| Sirloin tip steak  | 8          | 9          | -1               | 3.5         | -           |
| T-bone steak       | 9          | 10         | -1               | 3.5         | -           |

1 .
 H<sub>0</sub>: the rating distributions are the same (A = B)

 &emsp;
 H<sub>1</sub>: the ratings are different (A $\neq$ B)   with n = 10-2=8 (omit the tired pairs)

2 . set $\alpha$ = 0.05

3 . Test statistic = T = rank sum of plus signs (+)

4 . Realized statistic: T<sup>*</sup> = 3.5 + 3.5=7

5 . Use the Table with n = 8

Because this is a two-tailed test, we look for the critical values where the cumulative probability is $\alpha$/2 = 0.025

By the table, we can get the critical values are 4 (lower)

RR: {T &le; 4 }

6 . Because 7 &notin; RR, H<sub>0</sub> does not be rejected. There is no sufficient evidence to indicate that one of the two tenderizers tends to receive higher ratings than the other.

A paired ùë°-test is appropriate for analyzing these data because the data are paired observations (each cut was rated by the same judge, paired by specific meat cuts from the same steer and cooked together). This ensures that the pairs are dependent, making the paired  ùë°-test suitable for this analysis.
