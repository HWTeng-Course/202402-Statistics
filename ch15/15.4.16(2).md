## Solution

## (a)

| Cut                | A                | B                | Difference    | Rank        | Sign        |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Shoulder           | 5                | 7                | -2            | 7.5         | -           |
| Chuck roast        | 6                | 5                |  1            | 3.5         | +           |
| Rib steak          | 8                | 9                | -1            | 3.5         | -           |
| Brisket            | 4                | 5                | -1            | 3.5         | -           |
| Club steak         | 9                | 9                |  0            | -           | 0           |
| Round steak        | 3                | 5                | -2            | 7.5         | -           |
| Rump roast         | 7                | 6                |  1            | 3.5         | +           |
| Sirloin steak      | 8                | 8                |  0            | -           | 0           |
| Sirloin tip steak  | 8                | 9                | -1            | 3.5         | -           |
| T-bone steak       | 9                | 10               | -1            | 3.5         | -           |

1 .
 H<sub>0</sub>: the rating distributions are the same (A = B)

 &emsp;
 H<sub>1</sub>: the ratings are different (A $\neq$ B)   with n = 10 (omit the tired pairs)

2 . set $\alpha$ = 0.05

3 . Test statistic = x = number of plus signs (+)

4 . Realized statistic: x<sup>#</sup> = 11

5 . Use Table 1 with n = 10 and p = 0.5

Because this is a two-tailed test, we look for the critical values where the cumulative probability is $\alpha$/2 = 0.025

By the table, we can get the critical values are 5 (lower) and 14 (upper)

**
The rejection region: {x &le; 5 or x &ge; 14}**

6 . Because 11 &notin; the rejection region, H<sub>0</sub> does not be rejected. There is not sufficient evidence to indicate that one of the chefs tends to give higher ratings than the other.

## (b)

1 .
 H<sub>0</sub>: the rating distributions are the same (p = 0.5)

 &emsp;
 H<sub>1</sub>: the ratings are different (p $\neq$ 0.5)   with n = 20 (omit the tired pairs)

2 . set $\alpha$ = 0.05

3 . The test statistic

 &emsp;
     $Z_{STAT}$ = $\frac{{x}-0.5{n}}{0.5\sqrt{n}}\sim Z$ 

4 . The realized test statistic

 &emsp;
     $Z^*=\frac{11-10}{0.5\sqrt{20}}=0.447213595\approx0.4472$

5 . For a two-tailed test,the rejection region is{z : |z| > 1.96}(5% level).

6 . Because 0.4472 &notin; the rejection region, H<sub>0</sub> does not be rejected. There is not sufficient evidence to indicate that one of the chefs tends to give higher ratings than the other.

## (c)

The results of the two parts are that H<sub>0</sub> does not be rejected, and the results of the two tests are the same.
