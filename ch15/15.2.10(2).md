## Solution
a.

We use the sign test to determine whether Assessor A tends to give higher assessments than Assessor B. Specifically, we test if \( P(X_A > X_B) > \frac{1}{2} \).

1. Compare each pair of property assessments:
    - Positive differences $(\+\)$: 6
    - Negative differences $(\-\)$: 2
    - Ties: 0

2. Formulate the hypotheses:
    - $H_0: P(X_A > X_B) = 0.5 $
    - $H_A: P(X_A > X_B) > 0.5 $

3. Perform a one-tailed binomial test:
    - Number of trials ( n ): 8
    - Number of successes ( k ): 6
    - Probability of success under $H_0$ : 0.5

4. Calculate the p-value using the binomial distribution:
    
    ${P-value} = P(X \geq 6 \mid n = 8, p = 0.5)$
    
    
    $P(X = 6) = \binom{8}{6} (0.5)^8 = 0.109375$
    
    
    $P(X = 7) = \binom{8}{7} (0.5)^8 = 0.03125$
    
    $P(X = 8) = \binom{8}{8} (0.5)^8 = 0.00390625$
    
    $P(X \geq 6) = 0.109375 + 0.03125 + 0.00390625 = 0.14453125$
    

5. Conclusion:
    - $P-value ≈ 0.145$
    - Since the $p-value > 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_0$ at $\alpha\ = 0.05$. There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that Assessor A's assessments are generally higher than Assessor B's.

b.

In this case, the t-test showed a significant difference (p-value = 0.013), suggesting that Assessor A tends to give higher assessments than Assessor B. The sign test did not show significant evidence (p-value = 0.145), likely because it is less powerful and does not take into account the magnitude of differences.
