## Solution
Part (a): Sign Test

We use the sign test to determine whether Assessor A tends to give higher assessments than Assessor B. Specifically, we test if \( P(X_A > X_B) > \frac{1}{2} \).

1. Compare each pair of property assessments:
    - Positive differences (\(+\)): 6
    - Negative differences (\(-\)): 2
    - Ties: 0

2. Formulate the hypotheses:
    - \( H_0: P(X_A > X_B) = 0.5 \)
    - \( H_A: P(X_A > X_B) > 0.5 \)

3. Perform a one-tailed binomial test:
    - Number of trials (\( n \)): 8
    - Number of successes (\( k \)): 6
    - Probability of success under \( H_0 \) (\( p \)): 0.5

4. Calculate the p-value using the binomial distribution:
    \[
    \text{P-value} = P(X \geq 6 \mid n = 8, p = 0.5)
    \]
    \[
    P(X = 6) = \binom{8}{6} (0.5)^8 = 0.109375
    \]
    \[
    P(X = 7) = \binom{8}{7} (0.5)^8 = 0.03125
    \]
    \[
    P(X = 8) = \binom{8}{8} (0.5)^8 = 0.00390625
    \]
    \[
    P(X \geq 6) = 0.109375 + 0.03125 + 0.00390625 = 0.14453125
    \]

5. Conclusion:
    - P-value ≈ 0.145
    - Since the p-value > 0.05, we fail to reject \( H_0 \) at \(\alpha = 0.05\). There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that Assessor A's assessments are generally higher than Assessor B's.

Part (b): t-Test Results Comparison

In Chapter 10, a paired t-test resulted in a t-value of 2.82 with a p-value of 0.013. The t-test examined whether Assessor A tends to give higher assessments than Assessor B.

- The t-test and sign test might yield different results because they test different aspects of the data:
    - The t-test assesses the difference in means and assumes the data are normally distributed. It uses the magnitude of differences and actual values.
    - The sign test is non-parametric and only considers the direction (sign) of differences, not their magnitude.

- In this case, the t-test showed a significant difference (p-value = 0.013), suggesting that Assessor A tends to give higher assessments than Assessor B. The sign test did not show significant evidence (p-value = 0.145), likely because it is less powerful and does not take into account the magnitude of differences.

- Conclusion:
    - While the t-test indicates a significant difference, the sign test does not. This discrepancy is consistent with the nature of each test: the t-test is more sensitive to differences in the actual values of assessments, while the sign test only considers the direction of differences.
