### Solution(a)

#### Step1 :
- $H_0$ : *There is no association between the pretest and posttest scores. (ρ = 0)*
- $H_a$ : *The correlation between the pretest and posttest scores is positive. (ρ > 0)*

#### Step2 :
- Set $$\alpha = 0.05$$

#### Step3 : 
- Test Statistic : $$r_s = \frac {S_{xy}} {\sqrt{S_{xx} S_{yy}}}$$

#### Step4 :
|Student|Pretest|Posttest|Pre_Rank, $x_i$|Post_Rank, $y_i$|
|-------|-------|--------|---------------|---------------|
|Evan   |101    |113     |5              |6              |
|Riley  |89     |89      |1.5            |1              |  
|Jamie  |112    |121     |7              |7              |
|Charlie|105    |99      |6              |3.5            |
|Jordan |90     |104     |3              |5              |
|Susie  |91     |94      |4              |2              |
|Lori   |89     |99      |1.5            |3.5            |

- Realized Statistic : $$r^* = \frac{17.75}{\sqrt{27.5*27.5}} = 0.645$$

#### Step4 :

- Reject Region = $$\lbrace r | r > 0.714 \rbrace$$

#### Step5 :
Because $r^*$ do not fall into the RR, we do not reject $H_0$. That is, there is no evidence to indicate a positive association.

### Solution(b)
The p-value used Pearson's correlation coefficient is 0.01 < p-value < 0.025, which is smaller than $\alpha = 0.05$. Hence, we reject $H_0$. The results do not agree with the results of part(a) because Pearson's correlation coefficient measures linear relationship between x and y and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient measures monotone relationship between x and y.
