## Solution

#### Step.1  Calculate the difference between normal and stressful conditions.
#### Step.2  Eliminate the data with zero difference, and according to the |difference| give each data rank.

  | Subject   | Normal   | Stressful   | Difference   | Rank   | 
  |-----------|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
  | 1         | 126      | 130         | -4           | 5      | 
  | 2         | 117      | 118         | -1           | 1      | 
  | 3         | 115      | 125         | -10          | 7      | 
  | 4         | 118      | 120         | -2           | 2      | 
  | 5         | 118      | 121         | -3           | 3.5    | 
  | 6         | 128      | 125         | 3            | 3.5    | 
  | 7         | 125      | 130         | -5           | 6      | 
  | 8         | 120      | 120         | 0            | *      | 

#### Step.3  Calculate test statistics
$T$<sup>+</sup> = 3.5, $T$<sup>-</sup> = (1+2+3.5+5+6+7) = 24.5 <br>
$T$<sup>*</sup> = min{ $T$<sup>+</sup>, $T$<sup>-</sup>} = 3.5
#### Step.4  Hypothesis 
$H_0$ : The distributions of blood pressure are the same. <br>
$H_a$ : The distribution of blood pressure under stressful conditions is higher than  the distribution under normal conditions.
#### Step.5 Find the critical value
Check the table where $\alpha$ = 0.05, one-tailed, and $n$ = 7 → $T$ = 4

#### Step.6 Conclusion
$T$<sup>*</sup> = 3.5 ≦ $T$ = 4, so reject $H_0$ <br>
The data present sufficient evidence to indicate higher blood pressure readings under stressful conditions.
