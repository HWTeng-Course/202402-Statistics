###  Solution
#### How to determine Normality from a boxplot ：

   1. Symmetry of the Boxplot：the boxplot tends to be  symmetrically distributed around the median.
   2. Whiskers of the Boxplot：outliers should occur rarely and evenly distribute on the both side of the boxplot.
   3. Boxplot shape：the boxplot data from a normal distribution is considered to be symmetrically shaped, and the median should approximately lie on the middle of the boxplot.
  
### Conclusion
- According to the boxplot data provided by the question of 10.1.15, we can see that the median line lies approximately lie on the middle of the whole plot , also, Q1 and Q3 are symmetrically distributed on the both side of the plot. To briefly conclude, the boxplot data is from a normal distribution.
