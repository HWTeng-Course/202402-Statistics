1. From the F table, we get $F_{24, 24; 0.025} = 2.27$ and $F_{24, 24; 0.975} = \frac{1}{F_{24, 24; 0.025}} = 0.44$
2. The 95% confidence interval for $\frac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_2^2}$ is $\left[\frac{S_1^2}{S_2^2}\frac{1}{F_{\nu_1}, {\nu_2}; {\alpha/2}},\frac{S_1^2}{S_2^2}F_{{\nu_2}, {\nu_1}; {\alpha/2}}\right] = \left[\frac{2790}{1260}*0.44, \frac{2790}{1260}*2.27\right] = \left[0.99, 5.02\right]$
3. Since this CI did include 1, the variances should be the same. The conclusion is the same as that of part A.
