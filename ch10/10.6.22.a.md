### Question:
<img width="482" alt="image" src="https://github.com/HWTeng-Course/202402-Statistics/assets/163434814/a5a3c58a-d7b7-45da-94b1-1feef0884178">


### Solution:
a.

Step 1:
H<sub>0</sub>: $\dfrac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_2^2}=1$,
H<sub>a</sub>: $\dfrac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_2^2}\neq 1$


Step 2:
$\alpha = 0.05$

Step 3:
Test Statistic:
$$F_{STAT}=\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{S_{2}^{2}}\sim\ F_{({n_1}-1),({n_2}-1)}$$

Step 4:
Calculate:
$$F^*=\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{S_{2}^{2}}=\frac{2.96}{1.54}\approx1.9221$$

Step 5:
df<sub>1</sub>=n-1=14 
df<sub>2</sub>=14
(there is not column with df<sub>1</sub>=14 and thus we will use the nearest degree of freedom df<sub>1</sub>=15 ,df<sub>2</sub>=14 instead) 

approximate the p-value:

$$p-value>2 \times P(F>1.9221)>2 \times 0.1>0.2$$

[Teng: This part is wrong. ]

Step 6：

Conclusion：

If the P-value is less than the significance level, then reject the null hypothesis.
$$p-value=0.2>\alpha = 0.05$$
We do not reject H<sub>0</sub>, because there is not sufficient evidence to support the claim that there is a difference between the variabilities of the closing prices of the two stocks for the populations associated with the two samples.

Comment: At the last line of Step5, the inequality is wrong, the answer is $$p-value=2 \times P(F>1.9221)>2 \times 0.1=0.2$$
