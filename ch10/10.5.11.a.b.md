## Solution

11. Cerebral Blood Flow Cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the brains of healthy people is normally distributed with a mean of 74. A random sample of 25 stroke patients resulted in an average CBF of 69.7 with a standard deviation of 16.0.

a. Test the hypothesis that the standard deviation of CBF measurements for stroke patients is greaterthan  510 at the a 5.05 level of significance.
b. Find bounds on the p-value for the test. Does this support your conclusion in part a?
