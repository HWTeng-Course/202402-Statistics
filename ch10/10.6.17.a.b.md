### Solution:<br>
a<br>
1.<br>
 H<sub>0</sub>: ${\sigma_1^2}={\sigma_2^2}$,
 H<sub>1</sub>: ${\sigma_1^2}\neq {\sigma_2^2}$<br>
2.<br>
  set $\alpha = 0.05$<br>
3.<br>
Test Statistic:<br>
$F_{STAT}=\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{S_{2}^{2}}\sim\ F_{({n_1}-1),({n_2}-1)}$<br>
4.<br>
Calculate:<br>
$F^*=\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{S_{2}^{2}}=\frac{0.0625}{0.0144}\approx4.3403$<br>
5.<br>
critical value=f<sub>(49,49,0.05)</sub>=1.607 (calculated by excel)<br>
6.<br>
4.34>1.607,so we reject H<sub>0</sub><br>
Our conclusion: Batteries produced by the “suspect line” have a larger variance in length of life than those produced by the line that is assumed to be in control.

b<br>
p=1-0.99999954(by excel "=F.DIST(4.34,49,49,TRUE)")=4.6*10^-7  <br>

which means that the probibility of our assumption <br>
(batteries produced by the “suspect line” have a larger variance in length of life than those produced by the line that is assumed to be in control) <br>

is wrong=4.6*10^-7
