### Solution
The critical value of the right tail is given in the row with $df_{2} = n_{1} - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49$, $\alpha/2 = 0.05$ and in the column with $df_{2} = n_{1} - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49$ (note: the table does not contain $df=49$ , thus we will use the nearest degrees of freedom $df=40$ instead) of the F distribution-table in the appendix :

$F_{R} = F_{(\alpha/2)} = 1.69$

The critical value of the left tail is the reciprocal of the value given in the row with $df_{2} = n_{2} - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49$, $\alpha/2 = 0.05$ and in the column with $df_{1} = n_{1} - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49$ of the F distribution-table in the appendix:

$F_{L} = F_{(1-\alpha/2)} = 1 / 1.69 \approx 0.5917$

The boundaries of the confidence interval for the variance are then:

$F_{L} &sdot s_{1}^{2} / s_{2}^{2} = 0.5917 &sdot 0.25^{2} / 0.12^{2} \approx 2.5681$

$F_{R} &sdot s_{1}^{2} / s_{2}^{2} = 1.69 &sdot 0.25^{2} / 0.12^{2} \approx 7.3351$

We are 90% confident that the variance ratio is between 2.5681 and 7.3351.
