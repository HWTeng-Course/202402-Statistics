## Correct Answer
Recall from Section 7.4 that samples from normal distributions should results in histograms and stem and leaf plots exhibiting a relatively mound shape. Boxplots should be relatively symmetric with no outliers and normal probability plots should have points reasonably close to a straight-line pattern with no systematic pattern that is not a straight line.  

**12.** Not normal. The sample is probably from a uniform distribution.
