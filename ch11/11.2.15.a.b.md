### Solution

### (a) What type of experimental design has been used?

The experimental design used here is a completely randomized design (CRD), which is appropriate when the experimental units are homogeneous and randomly assigned to different treatments. In this case, the treatments are the different states.

### (b) Construct the analysis of variance table for this data.

#### Steps:

1. Calculate the grand mean.
2. Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB).
3. Calculate the sum of squares within groups (SSW).
4. Calculate the total sum of squares (SST).
5. Calculate the degrees of freedom for each source of variation.
6. Calculate the mean square for between groups (MSB) and within groups (MSW).
7. Calculate the F-statistic.

#### Calculations:

## Grand Mean (GM)

$$
GM = \frac{\text{Sum of all observations}}{\text{Total number of observations}}
$$

## Sum of Squares Between (SSB)

$$
SSB = \sum (n_i \times (\bar{x}_i - GM)^2)
$$

where \( n_i \) is the number of observations in group \( i \), and \( \bar{x}_i \) is the mean of group \( i \).

## Sum of Squares Within (SSW)

$$
SSW = \sum (\sum (x_{ij} - \bar{x}_i)^2)
$$

where \( x_{ij} \) is the observation \( j \) in group \( i \).

## Total Sum of Squares (SST)

$$
SST = SSB + SSW
$$

## Mean Square Between (MSB)

$$
MSB = \frac{SSB}{df_{B}}
$$

where \( df_{B} \) is the degrees of freedom between groups.

## Mean Square Within (MSW)

$$
MSW = \frac{SSW}{df_{W}}
$$

where \( df_{W} \) is the degrees of freedom within groups.

(Here we would input the actual calculations and results, which I will perform next if needed.)
## F-Statistic

$$
F = \frac{MSB}{MSW}
$$

#### ANOVA Table:

| Source       | SS (Sum of Squares) | df (Degrees of Freedom) | MS(Mean Square)| F Value |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| Between (B)  | SSB                 | dfB                     | MSB            | F       |
| Within (W)   | SSW                 | dfW                     | MSW            |         |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| Total        | SST                 |                         |                |         |
