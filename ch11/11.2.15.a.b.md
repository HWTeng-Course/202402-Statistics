### Solution

### (a) What type of experimental design has been used?

In this problem, the builder used a randomized complete block design (RCBD) to compare the prices per 1000 board meters of standard or better grade framing lumber from suppliers in four states.It is appropriate when the experimental units are homogeneous and randomly assigned to different treatments. In this case, the treatments are the different states.

### (b) Construct the analysis of variance table for this data.

#### Steps:

1. Calculate the grand total (G).
2. Compute the correction for the mean (CM).
3. Compute the total of all observations (T)
4. Compute the total sum of squares (Total SS).
5. Compute the sum of squares for treatments (SST).
6. Compute the sum of squares for error (SSE).
7. Calculate the F-statistic.

#### Calculations:

## Grand total (G)

$$
G = \sum_{ij} X_{ij}
$$

## Correction for the Mean (CM)

$$
CM = \frac{G^2}{n}
$$

## Total of all observations ($T_i$)

$$
T_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} X_{ij}
$$

## Total Sum of Squares (TSS)

$$
TSS = \sum_{ij} X_{ij}^2 - CM
$$

## Sum of Squares for Treatment (SST)

$$
SST =  \sum \frac{T_i^2}{n_i} - CM
$$

## Sum of Squares for Error (SSE)

$$
SSE = \text{Total SS} - SST.
$$

## Mean Square Treatment (MST)

$$
MST = \frac{SST}{(k-1)}
$$

where \( (k-1)) is the degrees of freedom between groups.

## Mean Square Error (MSE)

$$
MSE = \frac{SSE}{(n-k)}
$$

where \( (n-k) \) is the degrees of freedom within groups.

## F-Statistic

$$
F = \frac{MST}{MSE}
$$

#### ANOVA Table:

| Source       | SS (Sum of Squares) | df (Degrees of Freedom) | MS(Mean Square)| F Value  |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | -------  |
| Treatment    | SST                 | (k-1)                   | MST=(SST/(k-1))|F=MST/MSE |
| Error        | SSE                 | (n-k)                   | MSE=(SSE/(n-k))|          |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Total        | Total SS            | (n-1)                   |                |          |
