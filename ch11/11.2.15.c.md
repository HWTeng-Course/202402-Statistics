### solution

### steps  
1. H0:	μ1=	μ2=....=	μk VS H1: at least one mean is different
   2. F=MST/MSE=26.44
   3. df1=k-1=3 ; df2=n-k=16
   4. RR{ F: F>F.05=3.24}
   5. F=26.44, which falls in reject region. Thus, we reject H0. There is sufficient evidence to show that the average price per 1000 board meters of framing lumber differs among the four states.
