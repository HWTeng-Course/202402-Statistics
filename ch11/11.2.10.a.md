### Question

### Solution
1. $H_0:\mu_1=…=\mu_k$ &emsp; $H_a:$ at least one mean is differ
2. Set  $\alpha=0.05$
3. Test statistic and its distribution: $F_{STAT}=\frac{MST}{MSE}\sim F_{k-1}{n-k}$
4. Calsulate the realized $F^*$
5. The P-value that is given in the MS Excel output is 0.0251.  
P=0.0251=2.51%  
There is a 2.51% chance of obtaining the sample results of more extreme, when the population means are equal.  
If the P-value is less than the significance level, then reject the null hypothesis.  
6. because $P=0.0251, we reject* $H_0$ *at* $\alpha=0.05$.  
There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that there is a difference in the mean assembly times for people trained by the three programs.
