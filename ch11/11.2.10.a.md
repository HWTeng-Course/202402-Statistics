### Question

### Solution
1. $H_0:\mu_1=…=\mu_k$ &emsp; $H_a:$ at least one mean is differ
2. Set  $\alpha=0.05$
3. Test statistic and its distribution: $F_{STAT}=\frac{MST}{MSE}\sim F_{k-1}{n-k}$
4. Calsulate the realized $F^*$
6. \because$ $P=0.0251 \in$ R.R., we reject* $H_0$ *at* $\alpha=0.05$.
There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that there is a difference in the mean assembly times for people trained by the three programs.
