### ANOVA Table

| source    | SS                              | df                  | MS                                                 | F                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Treatment | SST = 42.556                    | $k-1=3-1=2$     | $MST=\frac{SST}{k-1}=\frac{42.556}{2}=21.278$      | F = $\frac{MST}{MSE} = \frac{21.278}{35.2053} = 0.6044$ |
| Error     | SSE = $465.02 - 42.556 = 422.464$ | $n - k = 14 - 2 = 12$ | MSE = $\frac{SSE}{n-k}=\frac{422.464}{12}=35.2053$ |                                                         |
| Total     | TotalSS = 465.02                | $n - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14$ |                                                    |                                                         |

## Solution
* $\omega=q_{.05;}(3,12) \frac{\sqrt{MSE}}{\sqrt{5}}= 3.77 \frac{\sqrt{35.2}}{\sqrt{5}} = 10.0 $

* $\omega =10.0$
### Conculsion
Since the difference between 108.86 and 105.4 is less than $\omega =10.0$ , there is no significant difference between population mean1, $\mu_1$ and population mean2, $\mu_2$.

Since the difference between 108.86 and 105.6 is less than $\omega =10.0$ , there is no significant difference between population mean1, $\mu_1$ and population mean3, $\mu_3$.

Since the difference between 105.04 and 105.6 is less than $\omega =10.0$ , there is no significant difference between population mean2, $\mu_2$ and population mean3, $\mu_3$.
